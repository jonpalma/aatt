					<h2>San Petesburgo</h2>
					<p>Saint Petersburg, known for its countless canals, like the Venice of the North, is also called, thanks to its rich artistic and architectural heritage, the Palmyra of the North and the cultural capital of Russia. Former capital of the Russian Empire, Saint Petersburg is famous for its white nights around the summer solstice, for being the window on Europe that Peter the Great built in 1703 and for the legacy left by all the tsars until the Russian revolution in the twentieth century. Since its creation the city was the main center of the empire, the most European of Russian cities, where universal geniuses such as Pushkin, Dostoyevsky, Gogol, Akhmatova wrote their works and where composers such as Tchaikovsky, Rimsky-Korsakov, Shostakovich and Stravinsky revolutionized the history of the music. </p>
					<p>Subsequently, the Russian historical and cultural evolution was reflected in its role in the Russian revolution and in the multiple changes of name of the city: Petrograd, Leningrad and again St. Petersburg with the end of the USSR. Currently, the historic center and its surroundings are part of UNESCO's world heritage. We invite you to discover this fascinating city, through unforgettable cultural and architectural visits of St. Petersburg of yesterday and today.</p>
